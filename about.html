    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Hello!</h2>

    <p>My name is Samantha (Sami), and I made this website as a project during the GWC Self-Paced Program. I've participated in many cybersecurity programs in the past few years, and they led me to realize that even the basic ways to protect people online are not as common as I thought they were. Hopefully this website will help some people, and spread awareness of what could possible be very dangerous if one isn't careful.</p>

    <p>For more information on me, here is a link to my personal website: <a href="https://samanthasniffen.github.io/GWC-personal-website/">My Website</a></p>
