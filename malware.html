    <h1>Malware</h1>

    <h3>What is Malware?</h3>

    <p>Malware is malicious software that is designed to get information or harm a computer. There are many different types, and many are fairly common. They are things people need to be aware of so that if they end up on a person's computer, they know how to deal with it.</p>

    <!-- First Malware: Trojian Horse -->
    <h4>The Trojan Horse:</h4>

    <p>Most people have heard a Trojan Horse. It is said to be used to end the Trojan War, hence the name. In the story, Odysseus designed a giant horse on wheels, and sent it as a "gift" to the Trojans. However, inside the horse, there were some Greek soldiers. Once they were in the city, they were able to capture it. In the same way, the Trojan Horse malware, is disguised as a useful program. Once one installs it, a variety on things can happen depending on what it was programmed to do. Most commonly it can install a backdoor on your device. This gives hackers a way to bypass all or at least the majority of the security protocols.</p>
    <p>Whenever a website offers a free program or file for one to download, be careful. It may or may not me legitiment. If it isn't, it could be very dangerous. A way to check is to look it up online. The internet will normally have at least a few answers for any question. Better safe than sorry.</p>

    <!-- Second Malware: Ransomware -->
    <h4>Ransomware:</h4>

    <p>Ransomware is another type of malware. It is also one of the most devistating types. The name should give people an idea of what it is from the start. Ransomware blocks the owner's access to their data, and either threatens to delete or publish it if the ransom is not paid. The worst part is that there is no guarantee that the victim will get their data back even if they pay the ransom. Ransomware normally uses phishing to spread.</p>
    <p>Many people I can imagine think this would never happen to them, because they aren't important or something of that vein. However, it can happen to anyone. Yes, companies are popular targets, but if a hacker finds a vulnerability in someone's system or network, they may use it. The way to protect against this type of attack, is to make sure to use safe passwords and to watch what one clicks on. If they don't get the opportunity, they are not able to hack people's devices.</p>

    <!-- Third Malware: Viruses and Worms -->
    <h4>Viruses and Worms:</h4>

    <img src='m/virus.jpg' alt='a virus coming out of a computer part' class='center'>
    
    <p>The last 2 types of malware I'm going to talk about are Viruses and Worms. The reason they are grouped together, is because they are similar. They are both infectious malware. There are differences, but they are pretty similar.</p>
    <p>A Virus is a piece of malware that spreads between computers and damages software and data. They can be attached to files, programs, excecutable files, and more. Their goal is to cause major problems for computers, and disrupt systems and networks. Things to look out for are programs closing on their own, unneeded pop-ups, being logged out of accounts for no reason, and emails being sent out without doing anything. There are many different types of viruses, so they will not all be the same. Precautions you can take are things like having antivirus software, not clicking on pop-ups, and being careful when downloading files.</p>
    <p>A Worm is similar to a virus, but it doesn't need assistance to spread. A viruse must have a host system and needs user action to go between systems and networks. A worm does not. They can go unnoticed easily if one isn't looking for them and doesn't have great security. Depending on what the creator wants it to do, a worm can do many things. Some spread other types of malware, and some can even help highlight vunerabilities. Some deturants are firewalls, using a network intrusion detection system, and keeping software and devices up to date.</p>
