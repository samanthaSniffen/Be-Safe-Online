    <h1>Be Safe Online</h1>

    <p>Many people around the world use technology. Cellphones, iPads, laptops, etc. We can to so many things as a result of this. Talk to people across the world, find information easily, play games, take classes on different subjects, and more. All of these things are awesome. Some however, are not so great. An increase in internet users means that unless you take proper precautions you could be stolen from, locked out of your accounts, and information could be spread about you that you didn't want to be public knowledge.</p>
    <p>This means that people need to know how to protect themselves and their devices. Unfortunately, the majority of people don't take as many precautions as they should. My goal is to help people learn how to protect themselves, and equip them with knowledge about specific hacking devices so that they can identify them and be more careful online.</p>
