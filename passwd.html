    <h1>Password Safety</h1>
    
    <p>Password safety is the easiest way to keep from getting hacked, and it doesn't take that much effort on the user's part. If you want to find out if you have a strong password or not, take this quiz: <a href="passwdquiz.html">Is Your Password Strong or Weak?</a></p>

    <h3>Don't share your password with anyone!</h3>

    <p>There are quite a few ways too keep your passwords safe, and this one might seem obvious, but unfortunately it isn't to some people. Many people share passwords and accounts to avoid paying for streaming services, or to show something to others, or just aren't careful of it. If someone gets one of your passwords and successfully logs in to one of your accounts, they can just change the password and you will be locked out. Never ever share a password with someone you don't know. Whether it be over the phone with someone who could be a scammer (not everyone is, just be careful) or an online friend you have never seen or met in person, don't share passwords with people if you don't know them. Even if you do know them, be careful and use good judgement.</p>

    <h3>Don't use a weak password!</h3>

    <p>Using strong passwords is very very important. Unfortunatly some of the most common passwords are "123456", "qwerty", "password", "password123", and more variations of those. Please please please never use any of those! Worst idea ever. Adding a few uppercase letters and a few numbers to make it "Passw0rd123" is still very unsafe. It is also unsafe to use something close to you, such as the name or birthday of a family member or pet, or something that is important to you or very related to you.</p>
    
    <p>The strongest passwords have a mix of lower case and upper case letters, symbols, and numbers. Using a passphrase can be helpful as well. A passphrase is a phrase that is easily remembered, but isn't realated to the user. For example a passphrase could be a book title, such as "TheFellowShipOfTheRing", or a random phrase, such as "MonkeyInATree". A random passphrase is advised.</p> 
    
    <p>Make sure your passphrase is long enough. The more characters in the password, the stronger it is. However having a password that is 20+ characters might be slightly unnecessary depending on what it is being used for. Sometimes it is smart to use long passwords for things like a wifi password which needs to be secure, and sometimes a shorter password is ok for things like a Duolingo account or a social media account. Even when making passwords for less important accounts, use a password that is betweek 8 and 12 characters long. Going below that length is not advised.</p>

    <h3>Create a strong password!</h3>

    <p>When trying to create a password, follow these steps. First think of a passphrase, like "apinkkoala". Next add some upper case letters to make it "aPinkKoala". Then mix in some numbers and symbols. You can even replace letters with symbols or numbers that look similar. Now you have "A!P1nk!K0al@". Is it 8-12 characters long? It's just at 12, which is great. Does that look like it would take a while to guess or for a program to decipher?</p>
